Therefore, it serves as a central system of record (SOR) and source of truth (SOT) for stream metadata. Stream Provider Plugin Architecture Stream Providers Stream Providers are plugins that work within the stream registry that implement the various bits and pieces of the stream registry that are both platform-specific and enterprise-specific. For example, the stream-registry will likely be open sourced with a generic-kafka-stream-provider to work with the Apache Kafka stream platform in a generic manner. Chances are, that Acme Inc, might want to expand on this generic functionality and add Acme-specific ConfigMaps and functionality. They can do so by extending generic-kafa-stream-provider to come up with an acme-kafka-stream-provider . These stream providers are typically jar files that have classes that implement the various manager interfaces depicted in the figure above. Manager Interfaces The following table describes a high level function of each of the manager interfaces . manager function Stream Infrastructure Manager Serves as an abstraction for stream bindings, the actual realization of streams in the underlying infrastructure. Schema Manager Serves as an abstraction for the underlying schema registry. Stream Source Manager Serves as an abstraction for managing stream sources. Stream Sink Manager Serves as an abstraction for managing stream sinks. Stream Replication Manager Serves as an abstraction for managing stream replication between clusters. The following sections will describe in detail what is features are supported by each of these interfaces as well as describing the interface requirements themselves. Stream Infrastructure Manager Stream Infrastructure Manager manages the declaration of namespaces and clusters as well as the management of stream lifecycles. Namespaces The Root Stream Registry Like DNS, the Stream Registry is hierarchical and has a 'root' namespace, / . The 'root' namespace is the default namespace of a vanilla stream registry. SHOW NAMESPACE / Note SQL 'DDL' syntax: This documentation uses 'DDL'-esque syntax to communicate command concepts . The actual API and/or command line tools may differ (the command line tools may use a stream config language and there will likely be a UI tool released that helps users interact with the stream registry directly). CREATE STREAM widgets_v0 ...; Let say that we leave this instance of the stream registry alone and deploy it such that its API is at https:// root-registry-api-uri An administrator can configure a second stream registry instance to have a different namespace: SHOW NAMESPACE / DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE us-reg1-xyz DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE /us-reg1-xyz The above might be used to declare a \"region\" in AWS us-reg1-xyz for the given VPC. This could be used for when there are \"multiple\" regions for a given single company. To declare a second \"region\", an administrator might perform the following command on yet another, third, stream registry instance: SHOW NAMESPACE / DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE us-aus1-dc01 DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE /us-aus1-dc01 This can continue to create a \"layer\" of namespaces to be used/configured however suits the administrator. In the example above, the namespace is being used for regions. However it could be used for other hierarchies. Lets walk through an example. Info It is recommended that a stream registry be available in the namespace that it serves. So in the example so far, we would have a stream registry in each region it was deployed. The \"root\" stream registry could be deployed in either region, or possibly a third region that represents the \"root\" namespace. In practice only \"leaf\" namespaces serve streams. \"Non-leaf\" namespaces serve as aggregators for child namespaces. Namespace example Lets say that Acme, Inc. company has 2 cloud providers and a company paas for 2 data centers: Cloud Region/VPC aws us-reg1-xyz aws us-reg2-xyz gcp us-reg1-foo gcp us-reg2-foo mpaas us-aus1-dc01 mpaas us-aus2-dc02 The administrator sets up 3 stream registries for the \"cloud provider\" namespace layer. -- deployed on AWS stream registry with uri: https:// aws-sr-uri DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE aws ; DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /aws -- deployed on GCP stream registry with uri: https:// gcp-sr-uri DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE gcp ; DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /gcp -- deployed on mpaas stream registry with uri: https:// mpaas-sr-uri DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE mpaas ; DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /mpaas Then lets say that the administrator already had 2 stream registries running with the following namespaces pointing at the root namespace / . Namespace us-reg1-xyz us-aus1-dc01 The parent registry of the us-reg1-xyz namespace is updated to point to /aws and the parent registry of the us-aus1-dc01 namespace is updated to point to /mpaas . -- on us-reg1-xyz DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// aws-sr-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /aws/us-reg1-xyz -- on us-aus1-dc01 DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// mpaas-sr-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /mpaas/us-aus1-dc01 In this manner, arbitrary topologies can be created. An enterprise can start with one region, one cluster, and later, easily expand to multiple regions, multiple data centers, multiple clouds, and eventually multiple companies. This becomes extremely useful, especially during mergers for fast sharing of data, allowing teams to adapt to the streams and eventually merge appropriately over time. Clusters The following declares 3 clusters in one stream registry (for the /us-aus1-dc01 namespace): SHOW NAMESPACE; /us-aus1-dc01 DECLARE CLUSTER cluster001 ; DECLARE CLUSTER cluster002 ; DECLARE CLUSTER cluster003 ; The following declares 1 cluster in another stream registry (for the /us-reg1-xyz namespace): -- Performed on us-reg1-xyz SHOW NAMESPACE; /us-reg1-xyz DECLARE CLUSTER cluster004 ; Now with our namespaces and clusters declared, we can create our streams. Info The difference between DECLARE and CREATE , is that DECLARE may or may not have side effects depending on the infrastructure manager. CREATE is intended to explicitly have side-effects (eg. creation of the underlying resource). Streams The following creates, updates, or deletes a stream in the local namespace of the stream registry. CREATE STREAM widgets_v0 WITH CONFIG { acme.kafka : { owner : bob@acme.com , team : widgets-team , costcenter : 341D , } , apache.kafka : { partitions : 10 , replication : 4 , min_isr : 2 , compacted : true , compression : snappy , unclean.leader.election.enable : false , key.serde : string , value.serde : specific , } } WITH PRODUCER CONFIG { apache.kafka : { acks : all , retries : 0 , enable.idempotence : false , } } WITH CONSUMER CONFIG { apache.kafka : { acks : all , retries : 0 , enable.idempotence : false , } } This command registers the stream widgets_v0 with the stream registry. At this point, there is no schema, no stream bindings, or other stateful operations associated with the stream. Only the metadata supplied will be registered with widgets_v0 . Note This stream registration happens locally (in the local namespace) only!!! Other stream registrations in other stream registries (whether connected or not) are allowed . This is to allow maximum flexibility and also reduce contention locking and consistency across namespaces for stream registration. The tradeoff is, that during inter-namespace replication, however, the stream must be explicitly created in the remote stream-registry before replication will be allowed to occur. If the stream is already created in the remote stream-registry, the latest schema of the source stream must be compatible with the schema in the remote stream to accept replication. Config Maps: This command also introduces the notion of a config map . A config map is a hashmap of config key-value pairs specific to a given stream-platform or enterprise. In the example above, there are two config maps: acme.kafka and apache.kafka . acme.kafka is a company specific config map that provides ownership and cost information. apache.kafka is a stream platform specific config map. Specifics for each config map vary from stream provider to stream provider. Some config maps can be defaulted, others may be required. Consult the documentation of your specific stream provider for details. Producer/Consumer Config Maps: The stream also defines producer/consumer config map defaults. These defaults are provided to stream-bindings, producer and consumer requests once the stream is bound to a particular cluster. Stream Binding config maps take precedence over stream-level config maps. By providing definitions at the stream level, configuration is simplified and only \"override\" configuration need be specified at the binding level. Now that we have our streams created with the necessary metadata, we are ready to \" bind the streams \" to a given cluster, so that they can start receiving and sending data. Bindings Stream bindings realize the streams in the underlying stream platforms. The following command binds the widgets_v0 stream to the cluster001 cluster: CREATE BINDING widgets_v0 TO CLUSTER cluster001 ; You can create multiple bindings per namespace and override any applicable stream level config maps. CREATE BINDING widgets_v0 TO CLUSTER cluster002 WITH CONFIG { ... -- override any cluster specific stream configmaps here } WITH PRODUCER CONFIG { ... -- override any cluster specific producer configmaps here } WITH CONSUMER CONFIG { ... -- override any cluster specific consumer configmaps here } Default Stream Bindings: The first binding for a cluster is declared as the default . This means, that when a producer or consumer asks for that stream without specifying a cluster, the stream registry will respond with the first binding created for that stream. DESCRIBE BINDINGS widgets_v0 | stream | cluster | default | | ------------+------------+---------| | widgets_v0 | cluster001 | yes | | widgets_v0 | cluster002 | no | Stream Infrastructure Manager Interface Stream providers should implement the following interface to manage stream-platform and company specific configmaps. /** * This interface is implemented by a stream provider to provide * stream platform and/or company specific requirements related to * clusters, streams and stream bindings. * * TODO - Future operations may deal with cluster creation * instead of just cluster validation */ public interface StreamInfrastructureManager { /** * Validates the configMaps provided for the given cluster are valid. */ void validateCluster ( String clusterName , Map String , ConfigMap configMapMap ) throws InfrastructureException ; /** * Validates the configMaps provided for the given stream are valid. */ void validateStream ( String streamName , Map String , ConfigMap configMapMap ) throws InfrastructureException ; /** * Creates the stream binding in the underlying stream platform. * ConfigMaps guide the creation of the stream. * * @param streamName the name of the stream to create. * @param clusterName the name of the cluster that the stream * should be creted on. * @param configMapMap the map of configmaps -- applicable overrides apply. * @throws InfrastructureException This is thrown when * the operation could not complete. */ void createStreamBinding ( String streamName , String clusterName , Map String , ConfigMap configMapMap ) throws InfrastructureException ; /** * Updates the stream in the given stream platform * with the supplied configmaps. * * @param streamName the name of the stream to update. * @param clusterName the name of the cluster whose metadata should be updated. * @param configMapMap the map of configmaps -- applicable overrides apply. * @throws InfrastructureException This is thrown when * the operation could not complete. */ void updateStreamBinding ( String streamName , String clusterName , Map String , ConfigMap configMapMap ) throws InfrastructureException ; /** * Deletes the stream in the given stream platform. * * @param streamName the name of the stream to delete * @param clusterName the name of the cluster where the stream should be deleted. * @throws InfrastructureException This is thrown when * the operation could not complete. */ void deleteStreamBinding ( String streamName , String clusterName ) throws InfrastructureException ; } Schema Registry The schema registry is responsible for storing versioned, sequenced set of schemas for a given stream. It is typically responsible for providing various compatibility levels and formats. The schemas can be provided by id, and are typically useful for \"at-rest\" storage (such as Hive). The actual details of the schema registry is deferred to the underlying schema registry. Partition Key Schema Each key of a stream message (event) has a schema. By default this is a string. REGISTER KEY SCHEMA ( string ) ON STREAM widgets_v0 ; | Subject | Version | Id | | ----------------+---------+-----| | widgets_v0 - key | 1 | 121 | Single Type Schema per Stream Each stream needs at least one type per stream. REGISTER TYPE SCHEMA Widget ( FILE widget.avsc ) ON STREAM widgets_v0 ; | Subject | Version | Id | | -------------------+---------+-----| | widgets_v0 - Widget | 3 | 347 | Streams can also support multiple types per streams. REGISTER TYPE SCHEMA WidgetNameUpdated ( FILE widget_name_updated.avsc ) ON STREAM widget_command_events_v0 ; | Subject | Version | Id | | --------------------------------------------+---------+-----| | widget_command_events_v0 - WidgetNameUpdated | 3 | 347 | REGISTER TYPE SCHEMA WidgetColorUpdated ( FILE widget_color_updated.avsc ) ON STREAM widget_command_events_v0 ; | Subject | Version | Id | | ---------------------------------------------+---------+-----| | widget_command_events_v0 - WidgetColorUpdated | 1 | 213 | Like the confluent platform, the determination of a stream subject is provided by a SubjectNameStrategy. See Martin Kleppmann's post on the subject for the mechanics of how Confluent does this. In practice bundled serializers will do this at runtime. For design time, the stream registry should provide delegation mechanisms to allow a developer to register the schema for a particular stream during the CI/CD phase for a given target environment. Schema Manager Interface Schema Registries must implement the Schema Manager interface. Info This interface was modeled upon Confluent's Schema Registry . @Data /** * POJO for representing a pointer to a given schema. */ public class SchemaReference { public SchemaReference ( String subject , long version , long id ); } public enum CompatibilityLevel { BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE , FORWARD_TRANSITIVE , FULL_TRANSITIVE } /** * This interface is implemented by a stream provider to provide * organization specific requirement to the underlying schema registry. */ public interface SchemaManager { /** * Register a new schema under the specified subject.

It can be another streaming platform, a traditional data store, an API, devices, an online spreadsheet, a mainframe -- basically its any data source and a monitor of changing events on that data source. First there needs to be a way of knowing which source types are supported by the given Stream Source Manager . SHOW SOURCE TYPES FOR CLUSTER cluster001 ; | -----------------| | SOURCE TYPE | | -----------------| | s3 | | cassandra | | jdbc | | kinesis | | postgres | | mariadb | | -----------------| Once the developer knows which source types are available, they can declare a stream source.

It can be another streaming platform, a traditional data store, an API, devices, an online spreadsheet, a mainframe -- basically its any data sink. A Stream Sink is essentially an export of a single sink stream to that data store. SHOW SINK TYPES FOR CLUSTER cluster001 ; | -------------| | SINK TYPE | | -------------| | s3 | | cassandra | | jdbc | | kinesis | | postgres | | mariadb | | -------------| First there needs to be a way of knowing which sink types are supported by the given Stream Sink Manager .

A namespace can be any hierarchy specified by current namespace and the parent namespace, recursively all the way up to the root namespace, \"/\". So, for a given stream-registry the current fully qualified namespace may be /foo/bar/baz . When a stream binding occurs for a given cluster, implicitly the cluster is appended to the end of the namespace path: /foo/bar/baz/cluster001 So if \"widgets_v0\" is bounded to \"cluster001\", then the fully qualified name of the stream is: /foo/bar/baz/cluster001/widgets_v0 Intra-NameSpace Replication Intra-NameSpace replication is when replication occurs between clusters in the same namespace.

This is the only interaction that requires cross namespace communication / coordination. Lets say there is a company called \"acme group\" and it has two different brands, \"brickco\" and \"rocketco\". Lets also assume that the local cluster002 is in the current namespace /rocketco/aus1/us-somewhere-001 . The remote cluster cluster034 is in /brickco/aws/us-reg1-xyz . Consider the following command: REPLICATE BINDING cluster034/widgets_v0 FROM NAMESPACE /brickco/aws/us-reg1-xyz TO CLUSTER cluster002 ; Note The developer is able to discover the remote namespace, cluster and stream via stream discovery . This is a achieved via a different stream registry ui service that aggregates known stream registry meta data across all known namespaces. By aggregating the metadata and indexing it, it packages all streams to allow developers to discover and monitor all data in flight. Note Also, this assumes that the \"widgets_v0\" stream already exists in the local namespace. (Presumably it already exists in the remote namespace and cluster). If it does not, the replication will fail. Future versions may also check that the remote schemas are all available in the current stream registry, if not then there is a risk of consumer error when a local consumer starts to consume from \"widgets_v0\" stream. Like before, we can monitor replication status.

For example, the stream-registry will likely be open sourced with a generic-kafka-stream-provider to work with the Apache Kafka stream platform in a generic manner. Chances are, that Acme Inc, might want to expand on this generic functionality and add Acme-specific ConfigMaps and functionality. They can do so by extending generic-kafa-stream-provider to come up with an acme-kafka-stream-provider .

The 'root' namespace is the default namespace of a vanilla stream registry. SHOW NAMESPACE / Note SQL 'DDL' syntax: This documentation uses 'DDL'-esque syntax to communicate command concepts . The actual API and/or command line tools may differ (the command line tools may use a stream config language and there will likely be a UI tool released that helps users interact with the stream registry directly). CREATE STREAM widgets_v0 ...; Let say that we leave this instance of the stream registry alone and deploy it such that its API is at https:// root-registry-api-uri An administrator can configure a second stream registry instance to have a different namespace: SHOW NAMESPACE / DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE us-reg1-xyz DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE /us-reg1-xyz The above might be used to declare a \"region\" in AWS us-reg1-xyz for the given VPC. This could be used for when there are \"multiple\" regions for a given single company. To declare a second \"region\", an administrator might perform the following command on yet another, third, stream registry instance: SHOW NAMESPACE / DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE us-aus1-dc01 DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE /us-aus1-dc01 This can continue to create a \"layer\" of namespaces to be used/configured however suits the administrator. In the example above, the namespace is being used for regions. However it could be used for other hierarchies. Lets walk through an example. Info It is recommended that a stream registry be available in the namespace that it serves. So in the example so far, we would have a stream registry in each region it was deployed. The \"root\" stream registry could be deployed in either region, or possibly a third region that represents the \"root\" namespace. In practice only \"leaf\" namespaces serve streams. \"Non-leaf\" namespaces serve as aggregators for child namespaces. Namespace example Lets say that Acme, Inc. company has 2 cloud providers and a company paas for 2 data centers: Cloud Region/VPC aws us-reg1-xyz aws us-reg2-xyz gcp us-reg1-foo gcp us-reg2-foo mpaas us-aus1-dc01 mpaas us-aus2-dc02 The administrator sets up 3 stream registries for the \"cloud provider\" namespace layer. -- deployed on AWS stream registry with uri: https:// aws-sr-uri DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE aws ; DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /aws -- deployed on GCP stream registry with uri: https:// gcp-sr-uri DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE gcp ; DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /gcp -- deployed on mpaas stream registry with uri: https:// mpaas-sr-uri DECLARE DEFAULT NAMESPACE mpaas ; DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// root-registry-api-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /mpaas Then lets say that the administrator already had 2 stream registries running with the following namespaces pointing at the root namespace / . Namespace us-reg1-xyz us-aus1-dc01 The parent registry of the us-reg1-xyz namespace is updated to point to /aws and the parent registry of the us-aus1-dc01 namespace is updated to point to /mpaas . -- on us-reg1-xyz DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// aws-sr-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /aws/us-reg1-xyz -- on us-aus1-dc01 DECLARE PARENT REGISTRY https:// mpaas-sr-uri ; SHOW NAMESPACE; /mpaas/us-aus1-dc01 In this manner, arbitrary topologies can be created. An enterprise can start with one region, one cluster, and later, easily expand to multiple regions, multiple data centers, multiple clouds, and eventually multiple companies.

At this point, there is no schema, no stream bindings, or other stateful operations associated with the stream. Only the metadata supplied will be registered with widgets_v0 . Note This stream registration happens locally (in the local namespace) only!!! Other stream registrations in other stream registries (whether connected or not) are allowed . This is to allow maximum flexibility and also reduce contention locking and consistency across namespaces for stream registration. The tradeoff is, that during inter-namespace replication, however, the stream must be explicitly created in the remote stream-registry before replication will be allowed to occur. If the stream is already created in the remote stream-registry, the latest schema of the source stream must be compatible with the schema in the remote stream to accept replication. Config Maps: This command also introduces the notion of a config map . A config map is a hashmap of config key-value pairs specific to a given stream-platform or enterprise. In the example above, there are two config maps: acme.kafka and apache.kafka . acme.kafka is a company specific config map that provides ownership and cost information. apache.kafka is a stream platform specific config map. Specifics for each config map vary from stream provider to stream provider. Some config maps can be defaulted, others may be required. Consult the documentation of your specific stream provider for details. Producer/Consumer Config Maps: The stream also defines producer/consumer config map defaults. These defaults are provided to stream-bindings, producer and consumer requests once the stream is bound to a particular cluster. Stream Binding config maps take precedence over stream-level config maps. By providing definitions at the stream level, configuration is simplified and only \"override\" configuration need be specified at the binding level. Now that we have our streams created with the necessary metadata, we are ready to \" bind the streams \" to a given cluster, so that they can start receiving and sending data.","title":"Streams"},{"location":"architecture/#bindings","text":"Stream bindings realize the streams in the underlying stream platforms.

A namespace can be any hierarchy specified by current namespace and the parent namespace, recursively all the way up to the root namespace, \"/\". So, for a given stream-registry the current fully qualified namespace may be /foo/bar/baz . When a stream binding occurs for a given cluster, implicitly the cluster is appended to the end of the namespace path: /foo/bar/baz/cluster001 So if \"widgets_v0\" is bounded to \"cluster001\", then the fully qualified name of the stream is: /foo/bar/baz/cluster001/widgets_v0 Intra-NameSpace Replication Intra-NameSpace replication is when replication occurs between clusters in the same namespace. REPLICATE BINDING cluster001/widgets_v0 TO CLUSTER cluster002 ; This operation replicates the stream from cluster001/widgets_v0 (in the current namespace, as specified by no leading slash, implying \"current namespace\") to cluster002 . Info The important thing to note is that the underlying stream on cluster002 (if any for widgets_v0), still exists. There will be an additional stream binding, on cluster002 specifically named cluster001/widgets_v0 to signify this topic originates from cluster001/widgets_v0 and not from cluster002. The developer can also query the state of the replication.

This is the only interaction that requires cross namespace communication / coordination. Lets say there is a company called \"acme group\" and it has two different brands, \"brickco\" and \"rocketco\". Lets also assume that the local cluster002 is in the current namespace /rocketco/aus1/us-somewhere-001 . The remote cluster cluster034 is in /brickco/aws/us-reg1-xyz . Consider the following command: REPLICATE BINDING cluster034/widgets_v0 FROM NAMESPACE /brickco/aws/us-reg1-xyz TO CLUSTER cluster002 ; Note The developer is able to discover the remote namespace, cluster and stream via stream discovery . This is a achieved via a different stream registry ui service that aggregates known stream registry meta data across all known namespaces. By aggregating the metadata and indexing it, it packages all streams to allow developers to discover and monitor all data in flight. Note Also, this assumes that the \"widgets_v0\" stream already exists in the local namespace. (Presumably it already exists in the remote namespace and cluster). If it does not, the replication will fail. Future versions may also check that the remote schemas are all available in the current stream registry, if not then there is a risk of consumer error when a local consumer starts to consume from \"widgets_v0\" stream. Like before, we can monitor replication status.
